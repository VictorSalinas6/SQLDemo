SELECT Name, Price FROM products

SELECT * FROM employees

-- This changes the title to something better, like a nickname the "as"
SELECT SUM(Price) as "Total Price" from products as p;

-- With LIKE : d% starts with d, %d ends with d, %d% contains d
SELECT Name, Price FROM products
WHERE Name LIKE "d%";

-- using insert
INSERT INTO products (Name, Price,CategoryID, OnSale, StockLevel)
VALUES ("VictorÂ´s Product", 500.00, 3, 0, 999);

UPDATE products 
SET Name = "Csharp-43"
WHERE ProductID = 942;

-- using delete, also be very carefull
DELETE from products
WHERE ProductID = 941;
